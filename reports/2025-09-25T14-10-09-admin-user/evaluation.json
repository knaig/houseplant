  "summary": "The user journey through the platform for managing and generating QR codes is generally positive, with clear navigation and a modern interface. While the task flow is efficient, there are areas of ambiguity in content and potential friction in the authentication process that could impact user satisfaction. The platform demonstrates a good foundation for admin users to manage the platform and generate QR codes, albeit with room for optimization.",
